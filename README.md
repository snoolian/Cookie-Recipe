### Sugars
- 100gr White Sugar
- 165gr Brown Sugar[0]

### Cream
- 60gr Coconut Cream
- 10gr Milk[1]
- 1 Teaspoon of Salt

### Oils and Fats

### Flavoring
- 30ml 40% Dark Rum

- 185gr White Flour
- 1 Teaspoon of Baking Soda

### Chocolate

## Instructions
### Dissolving the Sugar in Coconut Cream
- In a small cup, mix the Salt and Milk until the salt is mostly dissolved in the Milk.
- In a small pot on a gentle low heat[3], mix the salted Milk and Coconut Cream and Sugars.
- Mix until you reach a homogeneous mixture, and remove from heat.

### Mixing the Fats and Cream
- In a large bowl, mix the Coconut Oil, Coconut Butter and the Heated Mixture until you reach a homogeneous state.
- Allow to cool to room temperature.[4]

### Creating the Cookie Dough
- To the bowl, add the Rum, White Flour and Baking Soda, and fold until no Flour is visible in the dough.
- Leave the Dough to rest for 20 minutes, and then give it a final mix.[5]
- Add the Dark Chocolate to the dough, and fold it until the chocolate is evenly dispersed into the dough.

### Shaping and Storing
- Cool the dough in a refrigerator for 20 minutes(or until the dough is firm enough to easily shape).
- With a spoon[6], take some dough and roughly shape it into small ellipsoids.[7] Optionally stuff something nice inside them - white chocolate and hazelnuts come to mind.
- Store in the freezer.[8]

### Baking
- Preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius on turbo setting[9].
- Place the frozen cookies[8] on a baking paper in the oven, with some distance between them[10].
- Bake for 14 minutes.(It should have cracks)
- Best served at room temperature.


## Notes
00. You can replace 165gr Brown sugar with 50gr Molasses and 115gr White Sugar.
01. Almond milk, Coconut milk, whatever you have at hand.
02. Some stores sell them as little Chocolate Nibs, I prefer to use regular chocolate bars(preferably with >50% cocoa), and dice them. This also leaves some chocolate-dust which I think adds a lot!
03. Less than 60 degrees Celsius to avoid denaturation.
04. 20-25 degrees or so.
05. This is called an autolyse. In the waiting period, the flour will moisten, and integrate better into the dough.
06. You can use an ice cream scoop if you've got it... Honestly it makes no difference how you take it as long as its about a spoonful.
07. Small flattened balls, doesn't really matter though to be honest.
08. The dough works best frozen when put into the oven. This also makes preparing it really easy - just take it from the freezer and into the hot oven.
09. Or whatever setting has a fan spinning and the heat comes from both up and down.
10. Around 3cm between them.
